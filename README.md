# Emoji-Prediction-Project


Given a text message including an emoji, the emoji
prediction task consists of predicting that emoji by
relying exclusively on the textual content of that
message. In particular, in this task we focused on
the one emoji occurring inside tweets, thus relying
on Twitter data.

The data for the task consists of a list of tweets
associated with a given emoji (i.e. label). The dataset includes tweets that contain one and only one emoji,
of the 20 most frequent emojis. I split the data in training and test data.
